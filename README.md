# Welcome

This repository is meant for holding Roblox-LUA scripts. It is 100% Roblox-LUA based and does not consist of other files besides config and markdown. Feel free to use any as I do not work on them anymore. If you are here for the patcher, heres a little understanding on it:

## Patcher

The patcher is meant for simple compiling your Roblox-LUA code and then reconverts all code back with a built-in translator and returns the code which can be used for executing.
